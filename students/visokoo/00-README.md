### About Me

#### Intro
I started out in the tech world as a Helpdesk Specialist and was given 
the opportunity move into the DevOps space about 2 years ago. It was a 
rollercoaster ride going from full Windows to Linux but I loved every
moment of it.

I've done some basic coding with ruby for some day to day tasks but I'm
really hoping to be able to do more with python like writing full-fledged
web apps or just something better than your standard script.

In my freetime I generally enjoy:

- Playing boardgames...
- Playing console/PC games...
- Thinking about solutions for work...
- Eating too much...
- Outdoor activities such as hiking, snowboarding, etc.

### Goal

I've done some basic coding with ruby for some day to day tasks but I'm
really hoping to be able to do more with python like writing full-fledged
web apps/cli tools or just something better than your standard script.
